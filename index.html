            <h2>The 12 Steps of FYA</h2>
            <div class="steps-container">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>We admitted we were powerless over frozen yogurtâ€”that our lives had become a swirly mess.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore our brain freeze to sanity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Made a decision to turn our toppings and our lives over to the care of a higher power, as we understood them (not the sprinkle shaker).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of our froyo receipts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <p>Admitted to the universe, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our toppings addiction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 6</h3>
                    <p>Were entirely ready to have our Higher Power remove all these defective self-serve techniques.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 7</h3>
                    <p>Humbly asked the universe to remove our shortcomings (and our punch card collections).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 8</h3>
                    <p>Made a list of all persons we had enabled with "just one more topping," and became willing to make amends to them all.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 9</h3>
                    <p>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would cause them to relapse at the toppings bar.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 10</h3>
                    <p>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were weighing our cups wrong, promptly admitted it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 11</h3>
                    <p>Sought through meditation and prayer to improve our conscious contact with our Higher Power, praying only for knowledge of their will for us and the power to carry that out (without stopping at FroYo shops).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 12</h3>
                    <p>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to frozen yogurt addicts and to practice these principles in all our dessert affairs.</p>
